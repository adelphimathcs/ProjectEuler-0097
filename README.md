# Project Euler Problem 97
## [Large non-Mersenne prime](https://projecteuler.net/problem=97)

The first known prime found to exceed one million digits was discovered in 1999, and is a Mersenne prime of the form 26972593−1; it contains exactly 2,098,960 digits. Subsequently other Mersenne primes, of the form 2p−1, have been found which contain more digits.

However, in 2004 there was found a massive non-Mersenne prime which contains 2,357,207 digits: 28433×27830457+1.

Find the last ten digits of this prime number.

## Adding and Contributing Solutions

### First Clone the Repository

The easiest way to download the needed files is to clone the entire repository from your personal account. You will need to install [Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) for this. 

```
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/ProjectEuler-####.git
cd ProjectEuler-####
```

### Adding New Solution

To add a new solution, just create new folder in ProjectEuler-#### and place your files there. The folder should be the name of the programming language you wrote the solution in. If that folder already exists, put your files in there. If your solution is a mathematical write up, you can write it in a README.md file or post a write-up in LaTeX. If you choose LaTeX, make sure and post the source files, and not just the PDF.

Now that you have added your solution locally, you need to push it to the main repository. 

```
git add ./*
git commit -a -m 'message explaining what you added'
git push origin master
```


### Contribute to Existing Solutions

While anyone has the ability to modify existing files, it is best if you use GitHub's `issues` to discuss the changes with the original author before making any modifications. To modify the files, you only need to clone the repository, make changes, and then push your commits as above.
